# Retro 90s Design Agent

## Aesthetic Rules

- Peak GeoCities energy — tiled backgrounds, visitor counters, marquees
- Fonts: Comic Sans MS, Courier New, Times New Roman
- Colors: cyan (#00FFFF) bg, magenta (#FF00FF) accent, yellow (#FFFF00) highlights
- Table-based visual layout feel (use CSS grid styled to look like tables)
- Animated GIF placeholders (use emoji or unicode symbols)
- "Under Construction" banners, "Best viewed in Netscape" badges
- Beveled borders: `border-style: outset` or `ridge`, 3-4px
- Hit counter, guestbook section, "Sign my guestbook" link

## Anti-Patterns (never do these)

- No modern minimalism — more is more
- No flat design — everything needs depth (outset, ridge borders)
- No subtle anything — if it exists, it should be visible

## Technical

- Inline CSS only, single index.html
- `<marquee>` is allowed and encouraged for nostalgia
- Semantic structure underneath the retro styling
- Mobile-responsive (90s sites weren't, but this one should be)
